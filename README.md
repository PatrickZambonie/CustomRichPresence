# CustomRichPresence
**Set a custom rich presence activity in Discord**

CustomRichPresence (or CRP) allows you to, like the name implies, set your own custom rich presence activities in Discord. An 'activity' in Discord is what Discord will show you when you are playing something. A 'rich presence' activity adds more details to the activity, such as a description, image, time elapsed/remaining, etc.

CRP requires you to create your own application within Discord and provide its client ID, which is a much simpler and quicker task than it sounds. A guide is built into the program to help you to be able to set up your own Discord application. It should take less than a minute.

## Features
* A preview window that shows how the rich presense activity may look like (due to limitations, it is missing some things but whatever)
* Ability to change title, description, lobby settings, thumbnails, and time remaining/elapsed
* Some help features
